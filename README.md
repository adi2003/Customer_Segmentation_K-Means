# Customer_Segmentation_KMeans
This is RFM Model Based Customer Segmentation in the online retail Industry using K-Mean Clustering Algorithm(Unsupervised Learning) developed using Scikit-Learn, Numpy, Pandas, MatPlotLib and Seaborn.

This notebook is dedicated to the examination of an E-commerce database, cataloging purchases made by 4372 customers over a one-year span, ranging from December 1, 2010, to December 9, 2011. The primary objective is to Analyse the purchase pattern of different customers and group them into different clusters so that Strategic actions can be taken in order to cater their needs so that the store can create more value and profit. Integral to this analysis is the practice of customer segmentation, a strategic approach that involves categorizing customers based on shared characteristics. These segments prove extremely valuable in creating targeted marketing initiatives, identifying potentially lucrative customer groups, and fostering customer loyalty. Factors influencing segmentation includes demographics (such as age, gender, and location), behavioral patterns (previous orders and responses to messaging), as well as psychographics (including values, interests, and lifestyles).

An essential tool employed in behavior-based customer segmentation is RFM (Recency-Frequency-Monetary) analysis. This straightforward technique categorizes customers based on their transaction history, taking into account how recently they made a purchase, how often they do so, and the monetary value of their transactions. RFM analysis serves as a practical method for pinpointing high-value customers, comprehending their purchasing behavior, and executing precisely targeted marketing campaigns to enhance overall sales, customer satisfaction, and lifetime value.

The primary aim of this analysis is to uncover distinctive customer segments within a global retail company using the RFM framework. By employing RFM analysis, the objective is to discern how these segmented groups differ from one another. I used K-Means Clustering which is an Unsupervised Learning technique to group customers of similar behaviour into clusters.
